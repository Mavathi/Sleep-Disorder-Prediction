The main objective of this data science project is to analyze various lifestyle and medical variables of individuals, such as age, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, blood pressure, etc., and use this information to predict the occurrence and type of sleep disorder they may experience. Sleep disorders, like Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, can have significant impacts on an individual's health and overall well-being.
